# 🏥 Hospital Visitor Log on Aptos

## 📘 Project Description

The **Hospital Visitor Log** is a lightweight Move smart contract designed to securely store and track patient visit records on the Aptos blockchain. Each patient's address acts as the key to their own visit count, allowing for tamper-resistant logging of hospital visits in a decentralized and transparent way.

This contract includes two key functions:

- `register_visit`: Registers a new visit to a patient.
- `get_visitor_count`: Returns the total number of visits recorded for a patient.

By leveraging Aptos' resource model and access control, the system ensures privacy, accountability, and immutability of visitor logs.

## 🚀 Project Vision

- **Transparency & Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized modifications to patient visit records by utilizing blockchain's trustless architecture.
- **Decentralized Logging:** Eliminate the need for centralized hospital databases with a smart contract that anyone can interact with transparently.
- **Foundation for Expansion:** Serve as the base layer for more complex healthcare systems such as emergency tracking, patient visitor limits, or time-stamped logs in future updates.
